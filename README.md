# Personal Professional and Academic Webpage
This is my professional and academic webpage. In this webpage, I aim to showcase my professional experience, research projects, and other topics I am interested in. I have opted for a minimalist design to provide a clean and focused user experience.

## Todo List
- Remove placeholders
- Update content for all the pages
- Change links for buttons
- Improve design and layout of the webpage
- Include links to relevant publications
- Optimize webpage for mobile devices
- Add a contact form for visitors to reach out
- Regularly update and maintain the webpage
