            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Pablo Merchán-Rivera. Professionally, I describe myself as an engineer and data scientist. 
                I hold a doctoral degree in engineering from the Technical University of Munich.
                I love doing science and using my skills to find practical solutions to environmental issues, both in academia and industry.</p>
            <p>I'm originally from Ecuador and have been living in Germany for the past nine years.</p>
            <p>A few interesting things about me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🐊 I've caught crocodiles with my own hands (for their own good, of course, as part of a research project).</li>
                <li>🎸 I can play the guitar, sing, and dance salsa, all in a fairly decent manner.</li>
                <li>⚽ I love watching and playing football. At some point, I plan to create an app that analyzes football players' statistics.</li>
                <li>🎨 I pay close attention to detail in the graphical design of everything I do, from simple plots to presentations, 
                    from my notebook to the theme of my IDE. It's often a curse, as perfectionism often is.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my research, publications, and projects.</p>
